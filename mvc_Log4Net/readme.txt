# mvc_Log4Net2NLog MVC Log4Net conversion to NLog example 

Based on a previous proof of concept for Log4Net: https://github.com/edwardcampbellprojects/mvc_Log4Net

This is a straightforward conversion of Log4Net to an NLog minimal ASP.NET MVC Web Application

Follow the following steps to make this work on your system

1. Clone the application and run it in VS2015
2. You may have to refresh the Nuget packages
3. compare the Log4Net_TestController with that of the edwardCampbellProjects/mvc_Log4Net, https://github.com/edwardcampbellprojects/mvc_Log4Net, proof of concept to see the very small differences needed in the source code

 Run the app and select 'Generate test log entries'.
